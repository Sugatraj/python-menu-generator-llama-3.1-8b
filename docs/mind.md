-the generated menus should be stored in folder which will have json with menu images
    make a bash script, js or any script which will ensure when menu successful generation it will store in json with existing data.
    and in frontend create a section for previous generation and that section will be render from this json data
    so if i generate an menu successfully and push my code to git it will also push my json which will save my menus!
